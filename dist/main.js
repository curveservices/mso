One of our favourite violinists, New Zealander Benjamin Baker, on his fifth visit to MSO, plays both Samuel Coleridge-Taylor’s passionately late-romantic Violin Concerto and Vaughan Williams’ much-loved The Lark Ascending. To start we’ve a delightful suite of ballet music from Gustav Holst’s opera The Perfect Fool. And to finish there’s Elgar’s superbly crafted “symphonic portrait” of Shakespeare’s Falstaff. Elgar said he particularly enjoyed writing it, calling Falstaff “one of my best works”.\n        "),r=e("../dist/assets/mathilde.png","Mathilde Milwidsky",["Wagner - Overture, Die Meistersinger","Sibelius - Violin Concerto","Rimsky-Korsakov - Scheherazade"],"\n        Late-romanticism leaps to the fore in this highly entertaining concert. Wagner’s magnificent Overture from his opera Die Meistersinger paves the way for Sibelius’ powerful Violin Concerto. There’s an instant return for the young British violinist Mathilde Milwidsky, who made such a tremendous impression at her MSO debut in 2022. Rimsky-Korsakov’s Scheherazade is rightly popular. Gloriously orchestrated, Rimsky paints a series of wonderfully vivid musical pictures based on the famous collection of tales from the “thousand and one” Arabian Nights.\n        "),l=e("../dist/assets/iyad.png","Iyad Sughayer",["Mendelssohn - Overture, The Fair Melusine","Beethoven - Piano Concerto No.3","Schubert - Symphony No.9 “Great”"],"\n        This concert brings us musical classicism at the cusp of the Romantic Era.
